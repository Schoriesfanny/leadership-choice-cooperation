These are the necessary files for a complete replication of the paper “The Influence of Indirect Democracy and Leadership Choice on Cooperation”.
The experiments were conducted with the software ztree (Fischbacher, 2007) using the program that can be found in the folder named ztree.
The Excel files generated by ztree during the sessions are located in the folder “Analysis”. The do-file Data_Variables allows to extract those files in Stata and assemble the dataset.
If you only wish to recreate the results shown in the paper, you can proceed directly using all_subjects_qu.dta and the do-file Do_Tables.
